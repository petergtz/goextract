# goextract
A method extraction tool for the [Go](https://golang.org/) language.

This work is in very early development. The goal is to provide a refactoring tool that can [extract a method](http://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) from Go source code.

See [test_data](https://github.com/petergtz/goextract/tree/master/test_data) to see what extractions are currently supported.
